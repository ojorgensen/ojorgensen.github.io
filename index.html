<p> Hello! My name is Ole, and I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews.</p>
  <p> I'm currently participating in AI Safety Camp, investigating the introspective truthfulness of large language models.</p>

<p> Besides doing lots of Maths, the most valuable aspect of my degree was my involvement with the Effective Altruism Society. I was Co-President of the group for my last two years there.</p>

  <h2> <b> What I'm Working on: </b> </h2>
  <p> Ever wondered how a humble 1-layer transformer finds the minimum of two numbers? Wonder no more: I investigated how in excrutiating detail, and the results were pretty interesting and surprisingly clean!</p>
  <p> I compiled these results into a Colab notebook, which you can find <a href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1iKx6Nz4iaRTdlyutDKSRhvebjtwaQE4L?usp=sharing">here</a>. If you have any thoughts on this, please feel free to email me, or comment on the Colab! </p> 

  <p> I'm also starting work on my Dissertation, investigating how Neural Networks generalise out of distribution. I'm fortunate to be supervised by Murray Shanahan, Dylan Cope, and Nandi Schoots.</p>
  
  <h2> <b> Thoughts on Alignment: </b> </h2>
  <p> Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can with my career, I am currently trying to better understand how we can create advanced AI systems which benefit humanity. I think of this as the field of AI Safety, and I think it might be the most important problem we will face this Century.</p>
  <p> I see a necessary (but not sufficient) aspect of answering this question as about solving alignment: creating systems which do what we want, even as they become more powerful. </p>
<p> I have been focussing pretty seriously on forming my own opinions about alignment, alongside skilling up, since my degree ended in June.</p>
<p> Some of this has resulted in a few posts about alignment, which I intend to continue writing over the next year or so. You can find this through either my <a href="https://ojorgensen.substack.com">substack</a>, or my <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/users/ojorgensen">lesswrong!</a> </p>
 
  
  <h2><b> Other Things: </b> </h2>
  <p> Besides professional interests, I get a huge amount of joy from playing sports / being outside, especially when with other people. I am super keen on football, despite being pretty bad at kicking things. I used to play for the St Andrews Futsal team, and I also ran the Shinty team at St Andrews for two years, which is like Scottish hockey with less rules (and more fun).</p>
  <p> I'm also super keen on music, and am periodically interested in literature, meditation, and poker. </p>
