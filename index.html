subtitle: AI MSc Student, Aspiring Effective Altruist
---

I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a
MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews. I also helped run the 
Effective Altruism Society there for two years, and have completed two research
internships in pure mathematics.

Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can
with my career, I am currently trying to better understand the challenges of alignment.
I have written a few posts about alignment so far, and intend to continue writing more
over the next year or so. 


I really really enjoy playing sports and physical activity of most varieties, especially football.
