# Overview of me:

I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a
MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews. I also helped run the 
Effective Altruism Society there for two years, and have completed two research
internships in pure mathematics.


# Thoughts on Alignment:
Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can
with my career, I am currently trying to better understand the challenges of alignment.
I have written a few posts about alignment so far, and intend to continue writing more
over the next year or so. You can find some of my writing on my substack!
