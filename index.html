<p> Hello! My name is Ole, and I work in technical AI safety and governance. I'm an incoming PhD Student at the University of Oxford, and part-time Research Scientist at the AI Security Institute (AISI) with the Science of Evals team.
  Before that, I was a research engineer with the Chem-Bio team at AISI.
  Before that, I completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, and have received an MMath in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews.</p>

<p>
  I am always keen to talk to folks about AI safety. If you want to chat, just email me at o*surname*1417@gmail.com.

  <h2> <b> Recent Work:</b> </h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/early-insights-from-developing-question-answer-evaluations-for-frontier-ai">Early Insights from Developing Question-Answer Evaluations for Frontier AI</a> I wrote this blog post alongside Friederike Grosse-Holz! We share lots of in the weeds details we have learned from developing and conducting QA evaluations.</p>

    A follow up to work from my Dissertation, we develop a new method of activation steering, called mean-centring, which is more general than previous methods. We evaluate it in a variety of settings, including applying it to recent work on <a href="https://functions.baulab.info/">function vectors by Eric Todd et. al.</a></p>
