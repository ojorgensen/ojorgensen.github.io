<p> Hello! My name is Ole, and I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews. </p>
  <p> I also helped run the Effective Altruism Society there for two years. </p>
  <p> I have completed two research internships in pure mathematics. </p>


  <h2> <b> Thoughts on Alignment: </b> </h2>
  <p> Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can with my career, I am currently trying to better understand how we can create advanced AI systems which benefit humanity. I think of this as the field of AI Safety, and I think it might be the most important problem we will face this Century.</p>
  <p> I see a necessary (but not sufficient) aspect of answering this question as about solving alignment: creating systems which do what we want, even as they become more powerful. </p>
<p> I have been focussing pretty seriously on forming my own opinions about alignment, alongside skilling up, since my degree ended in June.</p>
<p> I have written a few posts about alignment so far, and intend to continue writing more over the next year or so. Like any good aspiring EA, you can find some of my writing on my substack! </p>

  <h2><b> CV: </b></h2>
  
  <h2><b> Other Things: </b> </h2>
  <p> Besides professional interests, I get a huge amount of joy from playing sports / being outside, especially when with other people. I am super keen on football and its indoor variants, despite being pretty bad at kicking things. I also ran the shinty team at St Andrews for two years, which is like Scottish hockey with less rules (and more fun).</p>
  <p> I'm also super keen on lots of music </p>
