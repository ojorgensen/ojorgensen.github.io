<p> Hello! My name is Ole, and I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews.</p>
  <p> I have completed two research internships in pure mathematics, and undertook research into homogeneous k-hypergraphs for my dissertation (think highly symmetric infinite graphs).</p>

<p> Besides my degree, the most valuable aspect of my degree was my involvement with the Effective Altruism Society. I was Co-President of the group for my last two years there.</p>


  <h2> <b> Thoughts on Alignment: </b> </h2>
  <p> Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can with my career, I am currently trying to better understand how we can create advanced AI systems which benefit humanity. I think of this as the field of AI Safety, and I think it might be the most important problem we will face this Century.</p>
  <p> I see a necessary (but not sufficient) aspect of answering this question as about solving alignment: creating systems which do what we want, even as they become more powerful. </p>
<p> I have been focussing pretty seriously on forming my own opinions about alignment, alongside skilling up, since my degree ended in June.</p>
<p> Some of this has resulted in a few posts about alignment, which I intend to continue writing over the next year or so. Like any good aspiring EA, you can find some of my writing on my substack! </p>
  
  <h2><b> Other Things: </b> </h2>
  <p> Besides professional interests, I get a huge amount of joy from playing sports / being outside, especially when with other people. I am super keen on football, despite being pretty bad at kicking things. I also ran the shinty team at St Andrews for two years, which is like Scottish hockey with less rules (and more fun).</p>
  <p> I'm also super keen on music, and am periodically interested in literature, meditation, and poker. </p>
