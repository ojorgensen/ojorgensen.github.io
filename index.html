<p> I am an AI MSc Student at Imperial College London. Before this, I graduated with a MMath degree in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews. </p>

  <p> I have completed two research internships in pure mathematics. </p>


  <h2> <b> Thoughts on Alignment: </b> </h2>
  <p> Motivated by my interest in using my career to do the most good I can with my career, I am currently trying to better understand the challenges of alignment. </p>
<p> I have written a few posts about alignment so far, and intend to continue writing more over the next year or so. You can find some of my writing on my substack! </p>
