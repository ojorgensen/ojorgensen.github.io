<p> Hello! My name is Ole, and I am a research engineer currently working at the AI Safety Institute with the Chem-Bio team. I've previously led research on language model evaluations and interpretability. 
  I previously completed an MSc in Artificial Intelligence from Imperial College London, and have received an MMath in Mathematics from the University of St Andrews.</p>

<p>
  I am always keen to talk to folks about AI safety, evals, and interpretability. I'm thinking about mentoring junior students on evaluations projects. If you might be interested, please reach out!

  <h2> <b> Recent Work:</b> </h2>
  <p><a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/early-insights-from-developing-question-answer-evaluations-for-frontier-ai">Early Insights from Developing Question-Answer Evaluations for Frontier AI</a> I wrote this blog post alongside Friederike Grosse-Holz! We share lots of in the weeds details we have learned from developing and conducting QA evaluations.</p>

  <p><a href="https://www.aisi.gov.uk/work/advanced-ai-evaluations-may-update">Advanced AI evaluations at AISI: May update</a> - I am proud to have contributed to this work! I helped design and implement our methodology for evaluating the chemical and biological capabilities of frontier language models.</p>

    A follow up to work from my Dissertation, we develop a new method of activation steering, called mean-centring, which is more general than previous methods. We evaluate it in a variety of settings, including applying it to recent work on <a href="https://functions.baulab.info/">function vectors by Eric Todd et. al.</a></p>
